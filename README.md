FOR THE TEST.HTML
The application's structure, which includes a heading, a form for entering a Pokemon name, and an empty div to show the retrieved information, is provided by the test.html file.

FOR THE STYLE.CSS
The page's design is managed via the styles.css file. It applies contemporary design elements like padding, rounded corners, and hover effects to the form and button, designs the main heading with a lively color, and sets a backdrop color. A higher font size and top margin make the Pokemon information section easier to read.

FOR THE SCRIPT.JS
The logic for retrieving data from the PokeAPI is contained in the script.js file. After processing the input and listening for form submission, it retrieves the relevant Pok√©mon data. The name, image, height, weight, and kind of the Pokemon are displayed if the request is successful. An error notice appears if there is a problem.
